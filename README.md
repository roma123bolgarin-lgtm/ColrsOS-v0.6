My first os downoload here
This os is not real this is a small test of os
If you dont know how to test this os i say it
First downoload MSYS2 https://www.msys2.org/
Next if you downoload MSYS2 to next step you need to downoload QEMU https://www.qemu.org/download/#windows and install nasm https://www.nasm.us/pub/nasm/releasebuilds/ --> 3.01rc9/ --> win 64/ --> downoload exe or zip
Final if you want to start it first you do this combinate Win+R AppData --> Local --> bin --> NASM and drop these four files in my os folder into this folder boot.bin boot.asm kernel.asm kernel.bin run nasm in your desktop and copy this command qemu-system-x86_64 -drive format=raw,file=disk.img and congratulations if you do it correct you see this os
If it doesnt help type me a problem to my Telegram @hlezzik
Goodbye!!
